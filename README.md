# Chess
My chess game known as Vanta Black Chess is a fully playable two-person chess game. Both black and white are human controlled, there is no AI component. All standard chess rules apply including castling and pawn promotion. When selecting a piece, the game will automatically check all possible legal moves and highlight them in red. The game can detect check mates and stale mates but not draws which must be manually declared. The game can be reset without restarting the program.
